# leave groups

leave all discord group dms or only ones you were added to by a specific user. forked from [leavemealone](https://github.com/diamondburned/leavemealone) to work with groups instead.

## usage

`go run main.go TOKEN USERID`

USERID is optional. if provided, only groups whose owner's id is equal to USERID will be left.
